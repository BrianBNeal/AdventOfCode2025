This is my solution for the Advent of Code 2025 programming challenges.

Per the organizers' request
>Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code? Please don't. Advent of Code is free to use, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.

I have not included any puzzle text or input data in this repository. Find each day's input using the link above and place in a text file according to the file paths used in each day's constructor (or update to whatever you like).
